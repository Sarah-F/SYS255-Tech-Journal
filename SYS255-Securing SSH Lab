Securing SSH

ðŸ’£Allowing remote access to a known user account like Administrator, root or admin for OpnSense is a terrible idea.  It allows an attacker to conduct an exhaustive attack using dictionaries of passwords against these known user accounts.  A security best practice is to disable Remote access as root.

How to disable SSH root user access to dhcp01.  Prove you have done this correctly by conducting a test via PuTTY.
      Use sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config to edit the config file for ssh
      Find #PermitRootLigin yes, underneath it write PermitRootLogin no
      Use sudo systemctl restart sshd.service to restart the ssh service.

Deliverable 1.  Once you are convinced that root can no longer login, provide a screenshot that shows how this failure was captured in the logs:
    cat /var/log/log/secure | grep "not met"

Deliverable 2.  Figure out how to determine what roots uid (user id is).  What is it and based on the logs, what logic is used to prevent root's login?
    If the user id is below 1000, then the account will be disabled.
