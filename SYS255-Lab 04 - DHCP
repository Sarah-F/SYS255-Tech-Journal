Lab 04 DHCP

SSH from AD01 -> DHCP01
Disable IE Enhanced Security Configuration: Use either PuTTY or Powershell SSH from AD01 to access your CentOS server from now on!
ssh sarah@dhcp-sarah

Follow instructions in image

Install PuTTY: download link in image

Connect via PuTTY: Follow instructions in image

Run the installation command as an elevated user, using sudo.
--> sudo yum install dhcp


Configuring DHCP Services
Become the system user for a brief period of time using the sudo -i command, and then open the dhcp configuration file using the vi or nano text editor.
    sudo -i
    vi /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf

Typing very carefully, enter the following into your new file below the comments (# denotes a comment).  Change the domain-name to yourname.local.
    #
    # DHCP Server Configuration file.
    #   see /usr/share/doc/dhcp*/dhcpd.conf.example
    #   see dhcpd.conf(5) man page
    #
    subnet 10.0.5.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
        option routers 10.0.5.2;
        option subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;
        option domain-name "name.local";
        option domain-name-servers 10.0.5.5;
        range 10.0.5.100 10.0.5.150;
    }
    

Starting DHCP Services

To start dhcp, type the following as root:
--> systemctl start dhcpd

Start dhcpd and check its status.  Note any errors and check the syntax of dhcpd.conf accordingly.
--> systemctl status dhcpd


Enabling the service to start at boot.

💣Forgetting to enable a service to start on boot will cause the service to fail when the system is rebooted.  Remember this if a service worked fine one day and does not after a reboot.  
--> systemctl enable dhcpd


Configuring the Firewall to allow incoming DHCP requests
The default configuration on CentOS is to enable the firewall and allow both ICMP and SSH requests in.  The DHCP server will not work until we enable the firewall.  We will be using firewalld and the firewall-cmd utility to make this happen.  The “firewall-cmd --list-all” option shows the default firewall that allows dhcpv6-client (not to be confused with dhcp server) and ssh.  We will add the dhcp service (as opposed to ports).
The following syntax adds the ports associated with dhcp permanently.  The --permanent flag is important.  If you fail to add this, the next time you reboot, your changes will be lost.  Make sure you reload the firewall to invoke the change.  List all the rules and make sure your dhcp service has been added.
💣Don't forget the --permanent flag, nor forget to reload! 

    firewall-cmd --add-service-dhcp --permanent
    firewall-cmd --reload
    firewall-cmd --list-all

Type exit to leave your elevated state and exit again to exit PuTTY.

Windows 10 DHCP Client
As a privileged user, you will now re-configure networking on WKS01 to use dynamic addressing rather than static addresses.

Follow image instructions (go to IPV4 properties and select Obtain an IP address automaticallly and Obtain DNS server address automatically)

Deliverable 1.  Take a snapshot of the results of ipconfig /all.  Note the DHCP server of 10.0.5.3 should be there, your IP address should be the first ip address in the range you set earlier.  Your domain name, netmask and gateway should also be set correctly.

Deliverable 2.  Log back into dhcp01 and find the dhcp log associated with wks01's request for dhcp information.  Take a snapshot similar to the one below.  The IP address, the workstation name, the layer 2 address should all match between deliverables 1 and 2.

The following command looks pretty complex, but let's break it down:
sudo - raises our privileges because /var/log/messages is owned by the root user.
cat - writes the file /var/log/messages to the screen
| - sends the output of the previous command to the next command
grep wks01-yourname - filters input for the string wks01-yourname.

--> cat passwd | grep name
--> sudo cat /var/log/messages | grep wks01-name



Wireshark
Run a capture session against WKS01's Ethernet0 adapter
As an administrative user.  Go ahead and release the current DHCP release and then renew it.  Your objective is to capture the four DHCP messages between client and server.
You release your current DHCP release using the following command:

ipconfig /release
ipconfig /renew
ipconfig /all

Stop the capture and create a wireshark display filter that shows UDP traffic sourced or destined to port 67.  Browse each of the four messages to get a handle on source, destination addresses (layer 2, layer 3) and ports and the sequence of messages used to provide WKS01 another leased IP address.

Deliverable 3.  Provide a screenshot similar to the one below that shows the 4 Key DHCP Messages.

Challenging Yourself
Deliverable 4. Figure out how to change the default lease time given to dhcp clients to 1 hour with a max lease time of four hours. Provide a screenshot displaying new configuration.
vi /etc/dhcdp.conf
default-lease-time  86400;   # 1 hour
max-lease-time      172800;  # 4 hours

Deliverable 5. Tech Journal Entry - Explore 3 other items related to DHCP, and dig into their related Wireshark captured packets.

DHCP has several different types of packets: 
Release: when the user sends a request to the DHCP server to release the users current IP address and cancel the leasen
Discover: when the user discovers the DHCP server
Offer: when the DHCP server offers the user an IP address on the network
Request: when the user accepts the IP address and asks the DHCP server to give it the address
Ack: when the DHCP server acxknowledges the request and officially sets the IP address tp the user
