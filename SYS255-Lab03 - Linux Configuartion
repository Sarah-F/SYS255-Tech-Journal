Added a privileged user using steps from previpus lab

Deliverable 1.  Login as the named user (not root!) and attempt to ping google.com, ad01 and fw01.  Provide a screenshot similar to the one below that shows the three successful pings.

DNS: Added an A and PTR record for dhcp01 to the DNS configuration on ad01. Tested this by issuing a ping from wks01 to dhcp01 using the undistinguished hostname.

Deliverable 2.  Using WKS01, Provide a screenshot showing the successful ping using dhcp01's hostname only (leave off yourname.local).

Deliverable 3.  Provide a screenshot that shows a successful ssh session as your named linux user.

pwd = show present working directory

cd /home
ls
= navigate to /home directory and list the contents

cd..
ls
= navigate up to the parent directory using a relative cd .. command.

ls -l = long listing of files and directories


man hier = show the manual page indicating what each directory in the file hierarchy is used for


cd ~
= Use the "tilde" shortcut to go to the home directory ~

mkdir = make durectory

sudo = will elevate privalages

groups = Show the groups your user has been assigned to. 

sudo -i = Become root for an extended time

Deliverable 4:

history | head -n 10 
=will show you the first 10 commands recorded in your history file

ls ~
ls -la ~
= This command lists those hidden files (those that start with a period)

ls .bash_history
cat .bash_history
= View .bash_history (if it is missing, logout of ssh and log back in again).

Deliverable 5.  This is a two part question:
What security implications does this file represent.  List at least one pro and one con.  
    Pro: Allows you to look at all the commands you have just used
    Con: This file is easily accessible, so it may allow others to look at all the commands you have just used
What command is used to clear bash history?
    cat /dev/null > ~/.bash_history
